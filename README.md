# Fraud detection with ML in finance report

Crawl, extract information from finance reports from 2010 to 2020 and combine to tabular data

Using F-Score and M-Score to evaluate and detect fraud.

\text{F-Score} = \frac{\text{Number of correctly predicted frauds}}{\text{Total number of actual frauds}}

\text{M-Score} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times \text{Ratio1} + \beta_2 \times \text{Ratio2} + ... + \beta_n \times \text{RatioN}

Where:

β0, β1, ..., βn are coefficients determined through statistical analysis.
Ratio1, Ratio2, ..., RatioN are specific financial ratios used in the M-Score model.
